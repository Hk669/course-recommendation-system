# Course Recommender System

## Overview

This Python application serves as a basic course recommender system based on content-based filtering. It uses the Flask framework to create a web service that recommends courses to users based on their specified interests.

## Features

- **Recommendations Endpoint:** The `/recommendations` endpoint accepts a `user's email` as a query parameter, retrieves their interests from a MongoDB database, and generates course recommendations using `content-based filtering.`

- **Content-Based Filtering:** The recommender system uses `TF-IDF vectorization` and `cosine similarity` to calculate the relevance of courses to a user's interests.

- **MongoDB Integration:** User data and course information are stored in a `MongoDB` database, and the application leverages the pymongo library for database connectivity.
